 ### User input
 "Bears are at the door, did you leave the garbage out?"

 ### Score : 4
 ### Score Reason 
  - BAD: in the vocabulary table it did not show the japanese characters, the cells are just blank
   - BAD: the beginner sentence is uncessary, should jsut start showing the vocabulary table
    - Good: The Clues were fairly Good.
    
 ### Assistant Output
  "Let's start with the transcription. I'll provide you with a table of vocabulary and some clues to help you work through it.:

    | Japanese | Romaji | English
    |          | kuma	| bear |
    |          | tobira | door |
    |          | gomi	| garbage |
    |          | noko	| leave behind |
    |          | aita	| was it? ( casual) |

 - Possible Sentence Structure
 Verb + + + Noun + ?
 - Clues
 The sentence starts with a noun ( Bears )
 The verb is in the present tense, but it's not a straightforward verb conjugation. Think about how to express "are" in Japanese.
 The particle is used to indicate the location of the noun.
 The second part of the sentence is a question, and it's asking if someone did something (left the garbage out). Think about how to express "did you" in Japanese.
 The verb is in the past tense, but it's not a straightforward verb conjugation. Think about how to express "leave behind" in Japanese.
 Now, try to transcribe the sentence using the vocabulary and clues provided. Good luck!"

 ### Assistant Output

    Sentence structure:
    [Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb-past]?

    Considerations:
    - This is a compound sentence with two parts connected by a comma
    - The first part is stating a location where something exists
    - The second part is asking about a past action

    Possible next steps:
    - attempt an answer
    - ask clues about location marking
    - ask clues about how to connect two sentences
    - ask clues about question formation
    - ask clues about verb conjugation
