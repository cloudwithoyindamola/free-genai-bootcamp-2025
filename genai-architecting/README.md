# Japanese Language Learning System
## Overview
A self-hosted Japanese language learning platform supporting 300 students in Nagasaki, ensuring data privacy, cost efficiency, and seamless integration with an existing learning portal.

### Use Cases
- Primary focus on Japanese language education for 300 active students in Nagasaki
- Self-hosted infrastructure for data privacy and cost control
- Integration with existing learning portal and learning record store
- Support for multiple learning modalities including sentence construction etc

#### Business Requirements
- Support 300 active students
- Ensure data privacy and copyright compliance
- Maintain low latency for local users
- Enable offline operation capability

#### Functional Requirements
- Japanese sentence construction assistance
- Progress tracking and assessment
- Multi-user concurrent access
- Integration with existing learning portal

#### Non-functional Requirements
- Response time < 2 seconds
- 99.9% system availability during school hours
- Data backup and recovery
- Security and privacy compliance

### Infrastructure Investment
- Budget: 10-15K for AI PC hardware
- Self-hosted solution due to concErns about:
 - Privacy of user data
 - High increment in the cost of managed services for GenAI
- Local deployment in Nagasaki office

### Cost Management
- Key cost factors:
  - Hardware maintenance and updates
  - Power consumption for AI operations
  - Bandwidth requirements for 300 concurrent users
  - Storage for language learning materials and user data

### Constraints
- Budget limitation of 10-15K
- Physical space requirements
- Power consumption limits
- Network bandwidth capacity

### Lock-in Prevention Strategy
- Using open-source LLM models (considering IBM Granite)
- Implementing modular architecture for easy component replacement
- Maintaining data portability through standardized formats
- Regular evaluation of alternative models and solutions


### Data Strategy
- Local storage of purchased learning materials
- Vector database for efficient language pair retrieval
- Regular backup and versioning
- Data validation and quality control

### Model Selection
- Self-hosted 7B parameter model
- Focus on text-to-text generation
- Optimized for Japanese language tasks
- Regular model updates and performance monitoring

### Infrastructure Design
- Local server deployment
- Load balancing for concurrent users
- Caching system for frequent queries
- Regular maintenance schedule

### Monitoring and Optimization
- Performance metrics tracking
- Usage patterns analysis
- Resource utilization monitoring
- Cost optimization strategies

### Security and Governance
- Role-based access control
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Regular security audits
- Compliance with Japanese education standards

### Assumptions
- Open-source LLM performance meets requirements
- Local bandwidth sufficient for concurrent users
- Hardware capable of running selected models
- Staff capable of maintaining system

### GuardRails Implementation
- Input validation and sanitization
- Output content filtering
- Usage monitoring and logging
- Rate limiting and access control
